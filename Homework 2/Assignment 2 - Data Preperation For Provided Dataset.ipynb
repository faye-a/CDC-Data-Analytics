    "I will create a cleaned dataset provided by the csv in the zip file. I will briefly introduce the dataset and talk about the different features that is present. We have 12 features present. The data are information about patients with some clinical data provided such as their symptoms. As we move to clean this dataset, the documentation states that these information are subjected to change, meaning that some data are to be verified by the CDC. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The documentation states that routinely performs data quality assurances to make sure logic checks are implemented. I will list steps that have been taken to clean data in this dataset already and I will mention this in the notebook further if such an occassion arises:\n",
    "* Features that have \"Missing\" have been treated as a seperate category as it means the question has been left unanswered and willl be treated as such.\n",
    "* \"Unknown\" is one of the choices for one of the questions in the form and so if it appears in the dataset it will be treated as it's own. \n",
    "* Some logical checks have been implemented, though only one has been included which is that if an illogical date has been given the CDC reviews the data. \n",
    "* It is important to note that some data levels are suppressed to hide the identity of some patients and they are re-coded as NA. These are never removed. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "_The 12 features are self explanatory._ \n",
    "* cdc_case_earliest_dt are dates that are related to Covid-19 or specimen collection, where the date may have been from when a case was reported to the CDC and they had recevied it. It is an option to end-users who need a date variable with optimized completeness. Meaning that if one of the dates are left blank, then use the earliest date available and if none are available it should be left blank.\n",
    "* cdc_report_dt are dates when the case was first reported to the CDC. It is populated using date when a case was first recorded to the database. If missing, then the reported date entered on the case report form was used. If missing then \"the date at which the case first appeared in the database was used. If none available, then left blank.\" (taken from website) This means that the missing values mean that the data is being used.\n",
    "* pos_spec_dt are dates when the first positive specimen collection. Specimen collection refers to a test, and so they are the dates in which a person had their first covid-19 test that resulted in a positive result.\n",
    "* onset_dt refers to the date the patient first started experiencing symptoms. \"If symptomatic\", meaning that missing data could entail that are asymptomatic. \n",
    "* current_status refers to whether they have severe symptoms of Covid-19 or meeting the criteria of being a probable case but no confirmed. Refer to this website for further clarification if needed. https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/08/05/\n",
    "* sex tells us information about the patient's sex.\n",
    "* age_group tells us the age group the patient falls into.\n",
    "* race_ethnicity_combined tells us the race or ethnicity the patient falls into.\n",
    "* hosp_yn informs us whether the patient was hospitalized or not.\n",
    "* icu_yn informs us whether the patient was admitted to the ICU.\n",
    "* death_yn tells us if the patient died as a result of this illness.\n",
    "* medcond_yn tells us if the patient had underlying medical conditions."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The table illustrates the duplicated rows given a certain date, 2021-01-05. It is sorted by age_group. We see that there are 481 suspected duplicates. The reason I narrowed this down so that we can see the duplicates and analyze them. We see a few duplicates when we look at the first 15 rows of rows_duplicates, where the rows are exactly the same for e.g. row 2014 + row 2052 are duplicates, row 6907 + row 6319 + row 8230 are duplicates. Though they are duplicates, I will not be dropping them. As I have stated before, these are individual patients and it is inevitable that we will encounter identical data when it comes to patient data. This is not an assumption as taking the population of the United States of America, there will be identical patient data when categorizing them. Additionally, the documentation states that some data for patient have been re-coded to missing to perserve their identities. I use this knowledge to further my point that duplicates should not be dropped, because matching NaN values for example is not feasable in this case."
