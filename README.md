# CDC-Data-Analytics
The repository contains 2 assignments that were made during my course.
* Assignment 1: Needed to understand data and prepare a dataset from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. We needed to make a Data Quality Report, Data Quality Plan and extend/combine features to better capture the problem domain and the target outcome (death_yn). (**to be added**)
* Assignment 2: Focuses on training and evaluating prediction models for a particular problem and dataset. The assignment continues to work with the dataset used from the previous assignment (above).
